# Epic: Authentication and Authorization Service

## Epic Description
Develop a comprehensive authentication and authorization service that provides secure user authentication, profile management, and role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities for the application ecosystem.

## Business Value
- Enable secure user access to the platform
- Provide centralized user management capabilities
- Implement fine-grained access control through roles and permissions
- Reduce security risks through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Support scalable user and permission management

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD Scenarios)

### Authentication Features

*Secure User Access:*
```
Given I am a valid user of the system
When I provide my credentials
Then I am granted access to the application securely
```

*Session Management:*
```
Given I am logged into the system
When I finish using the application or choose to logout
Then my session is properly terminated for security
```

### Profile Management

*Personal Profile Access:*
```
Given I am an authenticated user
When I want to view or update my profile information
Then I can access and manage my personal details
```

*Administrative User Management:*
```
Given I am an administrator
When I need to manage user accounts
Then I can view and manage other users' profile information
```

### Password Management

*Secure Password Recovery:*
```
Given I have forgotten my password
When I request a password reset
Then I can securely regain access to my account
```

*Password Security Maintenance:*
```
Given I want to maintain account security
When I change my password
Then my account remains secure with the new credentials
```

### Role and Permission Management

*Access Level Understanding:*
```
Given I am a user in the system
When I check my access permissions
Then I can understand what actions I am authorized to perform
```

*Administrative Access Control:*
```
Given I am an administrator
When I manage user access
Then I can control what roles and permissions users have in the system
```

## Implementation Notes
*The following technical details are for implementation reference only and should not drive the business requirements above.*

### Security
- Password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration

### Performance
- Database indexing for user lookups
- Caching for roles and permissions
- Efficient query optimization
- Connection pooling

### Monitoring
- Authentication metrics
- Failed login attempts tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

### Documentation
- API documentation with examples
- Architecture documentation
- Security guidelines
- Deployment instructions

## Dependencies
- Database system (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Email service for password reset
- Caching system (Redis)
- Logging system
- Monitoring tools

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation:** Security review, penetration testing, follow OWASP guidelines
- **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks
  - **Mitigation:** Load testing, caching strategy, database optimization
- **Risk:** Data breach
  - **Mitigation:** Encryption at rest and in transit, access logging, regular security audits

## Success Metrics
- Authentication response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime for auth service
- Zero security incidents
- Successful user onboarding rate > 95%
- Admin task completion time reduced by 50%
